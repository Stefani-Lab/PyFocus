.. function:: interface_custom_mask_focus_field_XY(n_list, d_list, ex_lens, ey_lens, alpha, h, Lambda, z_interface, zp0, resolution_focus, resolution_theta, resolution_phi, FOV_focus, countdown=True, x0=0, y0=0)

   2D integration to calculate the field at the focus of a high aperture lens with an interface
   ex_lens,ey_lens are the x and y component of the inciding field
   Calculates the field on the XY focal plane.

   resolution_focus is the resolution for the field at the focus, the same for x and y
   resolution_theta,resolution_phi is the resolution for the 2D calculus (must be the same as the sie of ex_lens and ey_lens) 

   wavelength is given in the medium (equals wavelength in vacuum/n)
   countdown=True means you are only running this fuction once and you want to see te time elapsed and expected to finish the calculation

   x0 and y0 are used for centering the XY field at an x0, y0 position

   The rest of the parameters are specified in sim.py
