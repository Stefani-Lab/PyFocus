This is PyFocus, a Python package that provides high-level functions and an user interface to perform full vectorial calculations of the focus of an electromagnetic field that has been modulated by a custom phase mask, while providing the option of simulating the free propagation of these fields under the paraxial approximation and the focus through an interface or a multilayer system.

You can find detailed information about the theorical calculations used in this package and a full description of many common use cases in the following paper:
